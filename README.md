# Visuale

## Inspiration
Wordle is a word-guessing game that has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few months. Each day, users have 6 tries to correctly guess a five-letter word in the English language, with hints following each guess. We love playing Wordle but wanted to make it more visually engaging.

## What it does
Visuale (vi-zhoo-AL) presents an image to the user, who has to guess the object that is portrayed in the image. Here's the catch: the image starts highly zoomed in and becomes less zoomed with each guess. The user has only 6 tries to guess the correct object. The objective of the game is to guess the object with the least number of tries!

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS to design the user interface of the web application. We used Javascript to record the user's guesses, select images to display, and cross-reference the words with a dictionary.

## What's next for Visuale
We still need to configure our domain (visuale.tech), but that is coming soon! We also plan to add more images to our database.
